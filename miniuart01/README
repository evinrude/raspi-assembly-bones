This example involves the miniuart. Most of the code has been encapsulated into common.
The idea is to build off of our common code to make doing stuff over serial alot less
labor intensive.

The example spits out the ABC's over serial @ 115200 8N1. A timer is involved so the rate can 
be slowed down.
